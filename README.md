# IPF

Here is the code necessary to run the application example in the Paper "Categorical Distributions of Maximum Entropy under Marginal Constraints". We show how to run the Iterative Proportional Fitting Algorithm (IPF) using the NHAMCS emergency department data. Furthermore, we demonstrate out subsampling approach to find the best-fitting MAXENT model.


Please run/compile `Rmd/NHAMCS.Rmd`
